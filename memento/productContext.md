# Product Context: TheTrybe Web Automation

## 1. Problem Solved
Manual regression testing of "The Trybe" website is time-consuming, prone to human error, and cannot be executed frequently enough to keep up with the pace of development. This project solves that problem by providing a fast, reliable, and repeatable way to validate the website's core functionalities.

## 2. How It Should Work
The framework should allow testers and developers to:
- Write new test scenarios quickly using Gherkin syntax.
- Run tests against different environments (e.g., staging, production) by changing a configuration file.
- Execute specific test suites or individual scenarios using tags.
- Receive clear, comprehensive reports that pinpoint the exact cause of any failures.

## 3. User Experience Goals
- **For Developers/Testers:** The framework should be easy to use and extend. Adding new page objects, step definitions, and locators should be a straightforward process.
- **For Stakeholders:** Test reports should be easy to understand, providing a clear overview of the application's health without requiring deep technical knowledge.
